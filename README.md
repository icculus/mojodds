# MojoDDS

This is a dirt-simple [.dds file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface)
decoder, in case you need to, for example, load these files into an OpenGL texture
on Linux.

This was just enough to do what I needed to do for a game I ported to
Linux. The file format was extended in later versions of DirectX, but
those additions are not currently supported.

If this is useful, feel free to plug it into your game.
